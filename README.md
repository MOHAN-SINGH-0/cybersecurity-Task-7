## Objective: 

Learn to spot and remove potentially harmful browser extensions.

## Tools:
Any web browser (Chrome)

---

## Extensions Report 

Extensions Found : None 

Shown in : `Extension.png`

I confirmed that no browser extensions are currently installed in my browser. This means:

- No third-party tools have access to my browsing data.
- No extension is silently tracking or interfering with my sessions.
- My browser environment is clean and secure.

## Security Reflection

Even though browser extensions can be useful, they can also be risky if:

- They request excessive permissions
- They are developed by untrusted or unknown parties
- They are not maintained or reviewed

By keeping my browser extension-free, I reduce:
- The attack surface for browser-based exploits
- Risk of data exposure
- Performance overhead caused by background extensions

## How Malicious Extensions Can Harm Users

Malicious browser extensions can act like spyware or backdoors inside your browser. Once installed, they can access and manipulate everything you do online.

## Common Risks and Attacks
  
Threat Type	                                                      Description

Data Theft	                        Malicious extensions can steal sensitive data like login credentials, emails, payment info, etc.
Session Hijacking	                They can hijack logged-in sessions (like Gmail, Facebook) by stealing cookies or tokens.
Keylogging	                      Some extensions log keystrokes to capture passwords, messages, or card numbers.
Click Hijacking                  	They can replace links on webpages to redirect you to phishing or scam websites.
Cryptojacking	                    They secretly use your CPU to mine cryptocurrency, slowing your computer.
Ad Injection	                    Injects unwanted ads or affiliate links into webpages, earning money for the attacker.
Permission Abuse	                 Extensions ask for broad permissions like "read and change all your data on websites" â€” then misuse it silently.
